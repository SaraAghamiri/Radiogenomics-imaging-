Abstract


Objective: Radiogenomics is a cutting-edge field combining radiology and genomics principles to find connections between medical imaging characteristics and gene expression patterns. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), significantly assisted in developing radiogenomics pipelines. We hypothesized that there is a lack of standard radiogenomics-specific guidelines, leading to issues with the consistency, reproducibility, and evaluation of findings in this field. 
Methods: A scoping review of publications in the field of radiogenomics was conducted to assess whether the original AI-based studies mentioned any standard guidelines in conducting their studies. We focused on the Medline database, accessed through PubMed, the National Library of Medicine's premier bibliographic resource. We analyzed details related to guidelines, datasets, and model availability from radiogenomics studies with ML and DL models published between January 2005 and August 2023. 
Results: We identified 83 publications, among which we excluded review articles, articles addressing radiation genomics, studies on non-human subjects, and articles that focused solely on external validation or the usage of other previously developed tools following our screening process. We identified glioma, lung cancer, and breast cancer as the top three disease categories for which an original model was developed. None of the studies followed a radiogenomics-specific guideline; 14 utilized public datasets, and 4 shared their code. Conclusion: We identified a knowledge gap and the need to establish standardized guidelines enhancing consistency and reproducibility in conducting and documenting AI-based approaches within radiogenomics research. While cancer remains the primary focus of radiogenomics model development, the field's extension into preemptive healthcare for healthy individuals offers a transformative potential for personalized medicine.
